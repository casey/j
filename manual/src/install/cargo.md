# Cargo

On Windows, Linux, and macOS, `just` can be installed using Cargo, the [rust language package manager](https://www.rust-lang.org). Install Cargo using the instructions [here](https://www.rustup.rs), then run:

`cargo install just`

(You might also need to add `~/.cargo/bin` to your shell's `$PATH`. If you can't run just after installing it, put `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"` in your shell's configuration file.)
